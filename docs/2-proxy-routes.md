# Proxy routes

Proxy routes forward requests to a backend service. Use them when you don't need to compose data and just want to pass through.

Use the `proxyRoute()` factory to create routes — it fills in the `type` field and provides a default `authorize` function:

```ts
import { proxyRoute } from 'halide';

const productsProxy = proxyRoute({
  access: 'private',
  path: '/api/products/*',
  methods: ['get', 'post'],
  target: 'http://products.internal',
  proxyPath: '/products',
  timeout: 5000,
  identity: (ctx, app) => ({
    'x-user-id': app.claims?.sub,
  }),
  transform: ({ method, body, headers }) => ({
    body: { ...body, source: 'halide' },
    headers,
  }),
});
```

## Key details

- **`methods` is required** — unlike `apiRoute`'s optional `method`, proxy routes require an array of methods. Supported: `'get'`, `'post'`, `'put'`, `'patch'`, `'delete'`, `'head'`, `'options'`.
- **`proxyPath` defaults to `path`** — if omitted, the route path is used as-is for path prefix rewriting.
- **`timeout` defaults to `60000`** (60 seconds) — uses `AbortSignal.timeout()` to abort slow requests.
- **`identity(ctx, app)`** — only called when `app.claims` is defined (private routes with successful auth). Returns a record of headers to inject into the proxied request.
- **`transform({ method, body, headers })`** — called when present. `method` is the lowercase HTTP method. `body` is the already-parsed JSON from the request. Headers are normalized to lowercase keys. The transform result's body is JSON-stringified before forwarding. Without transform, the raw request body is forwarded as-is.
- **`openapiSpec`** — provides an external OpenAPI spec source (local file path or URL) for documenting the proxied API in the Scalar UI. The spec is merged into the inline OpenAPI documentation.
- **`forwardHeaders`** — controls which request headers are forwarded to upstream. Defaults to a safe subset: `accept`, `accept-encoding`, `accept-language`, `cache-control`, `content-type`, `content-length`, `origin`, `user-agent`. Set to an empty array `[]` to forward no headers. Headers are matched case-insensitively.
- **`agent`** — Node.js HTTP agent for upstream connections. Use `http.Agent({ keepAlive: true })` for connection pooling.

## Path rewriting

The `path` is the incoming route prefix. The `proxyPath` (defaults to `path` if omitted) is the prefix on the target. The incoming path prefix is replaced with `proxyPath`:

```
Incoming: /api/products/123
path:     /api/products
proxyPath: /products
Result:   http://target/products/123
```

### Wildcard paths

If `path` ends with `/*`, it matches all sub-paths. If `proxyPath` also ends with `/*`, the matched suffix is preserved. If `proxyPath` is a plain path, the suffix is still appended.

```
# Wildcard with wildcard proxyPath
Incoming: /api/users/123
path:     /api/*
proxyPath: /backend/*
Result:   http://target/backend/users/123

# Wildcard with plain proxyPath
Incoming: /api/users/123
path:     /api/*
proxyPath: /backend
Result:   http://target/backend/users/123
```

## Host header behavior

The original `Host` header from the client request is **not** forwarded to the backend. Instead, the `host` header is derived from the target URL. The original host value is preserved as `x-forwarded-host`.

This prevents routing issues with CDNs that use the `host` header to route requests — forwarding the client's host header would cause 404 errors.

The following headers are stripped from proxied requests and cannot be overridden by `identity` or `transform`:

- `host`
- `connection`
- `content-length`
- `transfer-encoding`
- `set-cookie` (multi-value, not writable)
